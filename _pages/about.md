I am currently a 6th year PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University, advised by Dr. Eli Tziperman.

My research interests center on furthering our knowledge of physical processes in the climate system using a variety of tools including observational data, full complexity global climate simulations, idealized climate simulations, and toy models. My dissertation work has focused on two specific climate phenomena—first, mid-latitude coastal upwelling, a physical process responsible for sustaining some of the oceans’ most productive ecosystems, and second, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the largest driver of year-to-year global climate variability. Ultimately, I am motivated by both interesting problems in the climate system as well as interesting mathematics.
