I am currently a 6th year PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University, advised by Dr. Eli Tziperman.

My research interests center on furthering our knowledge of physical processes in the climate system using tools ranging from full complexity global climate simulations to toy models. My dissertation work has focused on two specific climate phenomena—first, mid-latitude coastal upwelling, a regional circulation responsible for sustaining some of the oceans’ most productive ecosystems, and second, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the largest driver of year-to-year global climate variability. Ultimately, I am motivated by both interesting problems in the climate system as well as interesting mathematics.

I am also excited about sharing my love of mathematics through teaching at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum.
